  "description": "Commonly used in image recognition, speech to text and text analysis, Principal Components Analysis (or PCA) separates the signal from the noise in your data and reduces your dimensionality so that meaningful analyses can be performed.\n\u200b\nAbstract\nPCA is vital for reducing high dimensional models with sparsity issues, without sacrificing the information contributed by each feature. In this talk, I will be explaining what happens under the hood during PCA, making the code and math accessible and interpretable.\n\nBio\nRumman comes to data science from a quantitative social science background.
