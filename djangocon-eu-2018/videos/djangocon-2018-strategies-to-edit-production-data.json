  "description": "Editing data in a production database is sometimes necessary. However, mistakes in running these queries can be disastrous. In this talk, you will learn strategies for making edits to a production database with examples from a Python stack that increase safety and auditability.\n\nAt some point, we all find ourselves at a SQL prompt making edits to the production database. We know it\u2019s a bad practice and we always intend to put in place safer infrastructure before we need to do it again \u2014 what does a better system actually look like?\n\nThis talk progresses through 5 strategies for teams using a Python stack to do SQL writes against a database, to achieve increasing safety and auditability:\n\n(1) Develop a process for raw SQL edits (2) Run scripts locally (3) Run scripts on an existing server (4) Use a task runner (5) Build a Script Runner service\n\nWe\u2019ll talk about the pros and cons of each strategy and help you determine which one is right for your specific needs.\n\nBy the end of this talk you\u2019ll be ready to start upgrading your infrastructure for making changes to your production database safely!\n\nJulie Qiu",
