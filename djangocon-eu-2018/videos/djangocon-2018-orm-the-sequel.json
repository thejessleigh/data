  "description": "This summer... a story of learning. She came from a different world, and must understand her new surrounds. Follow her on a journey of self discovery as she learns about... the Django ORM, via SQL.\n\nDjango tutorials often use the perspective of a complete newcomer to Python and web development, and while they provide a good practical on-ramp for brand new developers, they are often not quite right for developers from other backgrounds.\n\nThe common backbone of MVC development, no matter the base language, is the database and the language specifically for it's manipulation: Structured Query Language (SQL). But Django hides this behind it's amazing drawcard, the Object Relational Model (ORM).\n\nBut how can a developer already familiar with SQL get a handle on the ORM?\n\nThis talk endeavours to introduce the ORM using shared SQL and relational database concepts, showcasing the features the ORM uses to make database querying and manipulation a joy, rather than a burden, to the polyglot developer.\n\nKatie McLaughlin",
