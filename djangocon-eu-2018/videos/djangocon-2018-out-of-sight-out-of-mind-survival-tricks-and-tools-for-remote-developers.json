  "description": "What to do and what not to do in order to collaborate remotely on Django projects without losing your mind\n\nRemote working and \u201csmart working\u201d is very much in fashion these days, but what does it entail for the daily routing of a distributed development team? We will talk about tools, the disputed use of email, Skype, Slack but more specifically about time management, what you can expect from yourself and from other members of the remote team. Is your company \u201cremote-friendly\u201d or rather \u201cremote-first\u201d? When it\u2019s time to spend a few days in physical proximity with your colleagues? We will share some examples out of the experience of a distributed team actively working with Python and Django on a daily basis, and show how you can make it all work, if you work on it.\n\nAlessio Bragadini",
