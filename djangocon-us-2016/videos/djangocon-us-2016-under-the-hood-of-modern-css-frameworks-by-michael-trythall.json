  "description": "Together we\u2019ll look at the code behind Bootstrap, Foundation, Semantic UI, and other CSS frameworks. We\u2019ll identify common patterns and architectural decisions that make these systems so easy to use. Some of the things we\u2019ll discover:\n\nWhat it takes to set up a good type system.\nHow style and structure are separated to make theming easier.\nBest practices for stubbing out grid systems.\nHow configuration works.\nHow to make everything feel cohesive.\nWhat it takes to test a framework so you can potentially test your own.\nSo much more!\nIf you\u2019re looking to improve your skills with one of these frameworks or potentially roll your own mini-Bootstrap, this talk is for you.",
