  "description": "While the Python ecosystem thrives at in-memory data analysis, what is missing is a high performance, seamless integration with a persistent data store. When dealing with larger datasets, data scientists are forced to think more carefully about low-level bookkeeping details -- this inhibits discovery. SciDB-Py addresses this problem by providing a high-level interface to SciDB -- a high performance database optimized for array-based computation at scale.",
