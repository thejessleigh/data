  "description": "PlanOut is an open-source framework developed at Facebook for designing, implementing, and logging online experiments. This tutorial teaches you how to create both simple A/B tests and complex experiments in Python, as well as best practices for managing and analyzing experiments. We will also be taking a deep dive into how PlanOut is organized and can be extended to fit into production environments. For more information, see the PlanOut page on Github http://facebook.github.io/planout",
