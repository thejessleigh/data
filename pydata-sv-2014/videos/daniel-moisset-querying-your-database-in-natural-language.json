  "description": "Most end users can't write a database query, and yet, they often have the need to access information that keyword-based searches can't retrieve precisely. Lately, there's been an explosion of proprietary Natural Language Interfaces to knowledge databases, like Siri, Google Now and Wolfram Alpha. On the open side, huge knowledge bases like DBpedia and Freebase exists, but access to them is typically limited to using formal database query languages. We implemented Quepy as an approach to provide a solution for this problem. Quepy is an open source framework to transform Natural Language questions into semantic database queries that can be used with popular knowledge databases like, for example, DBPedia and Freebase. So instead of requiring end users to learn to write some query language, a Quepy Application can fills the gap, allowing end users to make their queries in \"plain English\". In this talk we would discuss the techniques used in Quepy, what additional work can be done, and its limitations.",
